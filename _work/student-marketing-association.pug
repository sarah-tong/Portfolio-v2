                        p The Student Marketing Association is Simon Fraser University’s (SFU) creative and innovative marketing-based student organization. They aim to bring together like-minded individuals who are interested in exploring the different areas of marketing, and are seeking to gain experience and skills through the various organizational opportunities offered. Through local business partnerships, mentorship, networking and skill-building events, their vision is to be launchpad for aspiring students to become empowered business leaders. 
                        p With nearly 2 years as part of SMA, I have taken on three roles. I began as a Graphic Design Coordinator and made a small number of graphics for SMA’s website and social media. Desiring more, I decided to apply for a Marketing Coordinator to promote SMA’s pillar event, Marketing in Focus 2015. Yet still wanting to develop visual design skills and gain management experience, I became the VP of Visual Communications, working alongside the executive team to promote SMA’s opportunities and provide mentorship to students. 
                        p Note: As the Graphic Design Coordinator role was very short term and had few projects, this page will only include the larger roles of the Marketing Coordinator and VP of Visual Communications.

                section
                    p As a Marketing Coordinator for Marketing in Focus (MIF), a conference where marketing professionals discuss various industry topics to students who are curious about a career in marketing, my main responsibility was communicating to students and inspiring them to attend the event. This position ran for 5 months.

                    h3 Landing the Brand Concept
                    p One of my first tasks was to work alongside another Marketing Coordinator to ideate a tagline for MIF. As we were both new to being a part of an Organizing Committee (OC) for a large-scale event of 102 attendees, as well as unclear about our roles, we were slow in making decisions. We had themes surrounding learning, growth, and exploration that we pitched to the OC, though it was another coordinator that came up with our final tagline, “Explore your horizons”. With a concrete theme and redefined, niche roles – I took on marketing communications while my fellow marketing coordinator took on visual design, we moved quickly onto branding.

                        div(class="col-50 img-col")

                    p With branding, the other Marketing Coordinator settled on a paper airplane as our logo to represent our tagline. With this, I challenged myself to think of ways that we could push the brand further. I wanted to take marketing offline to increase visibility and stir curiosity for our event, and so I created physical paper airlines. I designed blue paper airplane templates, such that it was consistent with SMA branding, and included our hashtag, #explorewithSMA, to spark an interest but not give too much away. These airplanes were intended to create buzz before MIF was announced. Initial promotion involved sharing photos of the OC folding and throwing paper airplanes, as well as attaching them to campus walls. However, as we had one too many airplanes made, we used them for other marketing purposes, such as in a promotional video, an activity at the ticket booth, and as a substitute for the usual, one-dimensional posters to direct attendees at the venue.

                    p Beyond campaigns, marketing communications was just as integral to my role. I created an extensive marketing plan that included actions items for social media posts. Such details included what day they needed to be posted, what social media platform, and written content. I made social media posts every other day on average. In addition to the social media action plan, the marketing plan described the theme or brand of the event, online and offline promotion strategies that will be used, and even pricing strategy, to ensure clear communication of my marketing efforts were understood internally within the OC and the Exec Team overseeing us.

                    p Although my role mainly involved marketing communications, I asked my fellow Marketing Coordinator for the opportunity to do some graphic design on the side. Luckily I was able to work on this skill and created some graphics to accompany social media posts, a one-pager to show during classroom pitches, and others, ensuring they visually align with existing material.

                    p I put together and managed the event website using Wordpress from start to finish. This included setting up a domain and installing a Wordpress theme to the final product. As I had skill in HTML/CSS, I used this to my advantage to reposition elements on the banner to better balance the space with respect to the image behind it.

                    p With the combined efforts of the OC and Executive Team, MIF sold out nearly two weeks before the event day. This is an exceptional accomplishment as I have observed in other events hosted by SMA and other student-run SFU business clubs, there are instances where ticket sales have fallen short. The successful outcome of an event with 102 attendees makes it one of my most accomplished moments during my undergraduate degree.

                    p I took on this role for the chance to hone in my visual design skills and there were more opportunities that I had anticipated. One of my first tasks to address a branding proposal that was left by the previous Executive Team. The proposal suggested a new logo redesign as it referenced Maslow’s hierarchy of needs model which is widely accepted as outdated and irrelevant in modern times. Moreover, the proposal suggested a new color scheme and depart from the near cyan blue as it is too strong and difficult to complement with other colors. I facilitated discussion with the team about the branding proposal, bringing up the argument that our logo’s inspiration from Maslow continues to be taught in marketing classes and therefore, still associated with marketing. Also, as SMA has had a strong reputation, a logo redesign runs the risk of losing loyalty. With the bright, near-cyan brand color, moving away from this would also run the risk of losing loyalty. After discussing with the team, we came to the conclusion that a branding refresh was more appropriate. I set out an updated branding guidelines that contains an unchanged logo, a more subdued shade of blue to give the brand a more professional impression, as well as good practices.

                    p Just as I have received mentorship when I was a coordinator, another strong reason I wanted this role was to pass it forward and support others in their personal and professional development. It first begins with finding the right individual via interviews who would be good fit with SMA’s culture and would have a lot to gain from the mentorship. From then, I mentored coordinators one-on-one which involved creating project briefs and training documents, as well as providing constructive feedback and guidance on the work they produce. 
                    p For another department within SMA, I developed workshops that introduced design tools and skills to as many as 9-12 students at a time. Using Photoshop and Illustrator, I taught students how to create their own resumes and Facebook banners.

                section
                    p One of the most important lessons I took away from is to be passionate in the work that you do. For MIF, our ticket sales were not performing very well at 3 weeks before the event day. The VP of Marketing came in and gave our organizing team an intense and passionate talk about how our drive to succeed was lackluster and wanted us to push harder so that when we look back on this in the future, we are proud that our efforts have led to a successful sold out event. And in no time at all, we sold of nearly 2 weeks before the event day and it was well received. That was a pivoting moment that shaped me to become more passionate which I have taken with me in the role as VP and beyond.
