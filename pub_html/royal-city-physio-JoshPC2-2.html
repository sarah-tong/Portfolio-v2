            <p>Royal City Physio (RCP) is an independent local physiotherapy clinic that prides itself on providing a high quality of individualized care through manual therapy, sports rehabilitation, and acute chronic injury treatments from children to athletes.</p>
            <p>We created a Home Exercise Program web platform that gives physiotherapists the ability to create and share ever-changing exercise routines for their patients. Our goal is to extend RCP’s quality of care from in-clinic to the post-session recovery stage. </p>
            <p>My role in this project was mainly focused on leading the team, interviewing, journey mapping, creating participatory workshops and facilitating it with RCP, ideation, content writing, and UI design.</p>

        <h2>Research Methods + Outcomes</h2>
        <section>
          <p>My team conducted research through two methods: an ethnography study to explore opportunities in enhancing RCP’s quality of care, and, once the opportunity was identified, a participatory workshop to gain a deeper understanding.</p>
          <div class="img-wrapper"><img class="blur lazyload" src="img/Knack/KnackMoodboard.png" data-src="img/Knack/KnackMoodboard.png" data-action="zoom" alt="collection of images on a moodboard"></div>

          <h3>Ethnography: Interviews + Observations</h3>
          <p>From an interview I conducted with a receptionist, we learned that patients face barriers during the onboarding phase. This includes new patients expecting private rooms instead of an open studio concept, requiring administration to explain and ease them; not realizing that they need to register their vehicle; and having frustrations around the booking system when their appointment is not successfully booked. The problem is particularly more apparent when the waiting area becomes busy and office administration are unable to give their usual verbal welcome and instructions. </p>
          <p>From an interview with a physiotherapist, we learned that when physiotherapists teach patients about their condition and provide exercises, this knowledge does not always get across to patients, either due to jargon, difficulty in visualizing, or comprehension. A potential cause of this problem is that physiotherapists prescribe exercises different ways, such as verbally, in handwriting, or through drawn pictures or photos. This results patients being uncertain of what to do, skipping their recovery program until the next time.</p>
          <p>Continuing from this education stage into post-session exercise phase, we learned from our interview with the physiotherapist that some patients struggle to access their exercise routines on the current online home exercise program. From observing a patient who walked us through the home exercise program, they were frustrated with having to open multiple email links and PDFs to get there. When patients do not understand exercise instructions, they tend to wait until the next session to clarify, delaying their recovery. As well, not all patients have access to their physiotherapist’s contact information.</p>
          <p>"Most patients won’t send me an email saying ‘Hey, I don’t know what I’m doing’. They’ll wait until the next appointment which is usually a week away so in that time they probably have not been doing any exercises for a week which is defeating the purpose of giving them home exercises." – Physiotherapist</p>
          <p>We then created three personas and mapped them to a customer journey map to visualize the gaps that emerged between what RCP wanted to achieve in their quality of care to what patients perceived.</p>
          <p>Of the three problem areas, the largest drop in RCP’s quality of care lies in the post-session exercise stage, a result of misinterpreted instructions and poor access to recovery routines. As our design focus, this stage plays a significant part of recovery because it relies on the patient to complete their home exercises. By helping patients overcome their frustrations and understand their physiotherapist’s recommendations, it can contribute to a more effective recovery and thus a more positive perception in RCP’s quality of care. As well, this problem area resonated with RCP the most.</p>

          <h3>Participatory Workshop</h3>
          <p>Focusing on the post-session exercise stage, we conducted a participatory workshop to gain a deeper understanding of the home exercise program. We created 2 exercises: (1) cognitive mapping to prompt RCP to lay out the process of how a physiotherapist would create and how a patient would access a customized exercise routine, and (2) H-Form to highlight frustrations and successes with the current home exercise program.</p>
          <p>We’ve gained 3 insights from this to explore in our design proposal:</p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>Although an academic project, we had exposure working with a client on a UX project and had to consider real-world limitations of not only financial resources but time and patient privacy as well. Despite these limitations, through learning and applying the various interaction methods of ethnography studies and participatory workshops, we were able to gain a good depth of knowledge and maximize the few on-site visits with had with RCP. Taking this research to a well-grounded prototype, we scoped this project to manageable goal where we as a team of experience designers can identify a business problem and design a proposal that is realistic for a small business to implement. </p>
