            <p>Royal City Physio (RCP) is an independent local physiotherapy clinic that prides itself on providing a high quality of individualized care through manual therapy, sports rehabilitation, and acute chronic injury treatments from children to athletes.</p>
            <p>We created a Home Exercise Program web platform that gives physiotherapists the ability to create and share ever-changing exercise routines for their patients. Our goal is to extend RCP’s quality of care from in-clinic to the post-session recovery stage. </p>
            <p>My role in this project was mainly focused on leading the team, interviewing, journey mapping, creating participatory workshops and facilitating it with RCP, ideation, content writing, and UI design.</p>

        <h2>Setting the Mood</h2>
        <section>
          <p>After the first consultation meeting with the founder, Nicholas Cragg, to understand his vision for the new website, I created a three moodboards showing potential visual directions for the website. What came out of the second meeting was tidbits from each moodboard, which included the use of blocks that echoes Knack’s existing logo; the Knack red as the primary colour but also using other colours to differentiate courses; aspirational photos of individuals to convey empowerment, success, and goal-orientation; as well as photos of students and objects that communicate a university feel. Lastly, to support the copywriter, the visual identity would be accompanied with the use of aspirational language that incite action, for example “Become a Powerful Scientist”.</p>

        <h2>The Website</h2>
        <section>
          <h3>The homepage</h3>
          <p>The main concern expressed about the old homepage was that it was missing a space for announcements and testimonials, the latter was hidden as a link in the footer. As well, what I observed was the absence of Knack’s tagline. Furthermore, there was the overuse of buttons in one area of the homepage and no context as to what a visitor may expect to see unless they clicked on it. </p>
          <p>For the redesign, to address the main requests, I included an announcement bar right after the hero banner as it is a place that deserves greater hierarchy for holding important information for parents and students. As well, the testimonial section is housed near the bottom of the page to reinforce the value of Knack’s service after getting an understanding of it from reading the above.</p>
          <p>Following the main requests, I used the hero banner as a space to draw emphasis on their tagline, “Discover Your Great Mind”.  In the “Knack Academics” section, I incorporated sliding animations that reveal images as you scroll to this section to bring emphasis to the tagline – the idea of discovery. In the next section “How We Help”, I used large, clickable blocks to move away from the usual button form, with each block reflecting a similar style as seen in <a class="in-text-link" target="_blank" href="http://maxolson.ca/portfolio/knack-academics/">Knack’s posters</a>. As well, each block contains content as an opportunity for Knack to communicate its value proposition. The last big redesign piece is the call-to-action to book at the bottom of the page. This is intended as a place for parents or students to get started after digesting the above, as well to maximize ease of booking without scrolling to the top again.</p>

          <h3>Services</h3>
          <p>The previous services page had each service on a new page, however each service contained just a short paragraph of content. In the redesign, I placed all services on one page but included a fixed, scrollspy navigation on the left to help guide a visitor through the content of the page.</p>

          <h3>Team</h3>
          <p>The previous team page held a dense amount of information that created a long page for scrolling. To reduce the amount of content of the page but still making it accessible, I kept key information visible which includes teacher availability and subjects taught. Reducing the information to these key points affords the ability for a visitor to easily compare teachers at a glance. To access the bios, hovering over the image causes an overlay with a magnifying glass icon to appear, suggesting interactivity. Clicking on the image will then reveal a teacher’s bio. With the absence of touch interaction on mobile, the overlay will appear as you scroll. </p>

          <h3>Student Resources</h3>
          <p>With Student Resources, also known as Knack Club, it had a very different look and feel that felt detached from the old website. For the redesign, I had to work within the constraint of a specific structure that Nicholas had envisioned. Specifically, for the Knack Club landing page, the subject should be laid out more prominently rather than within the navigation as previously done. As well, from clicking a subject, it would allow a visitor to access a course’s unit directly, whereas before, it required clicking on a subject, then course, then unit. Furthermore, within a unit, there would be a 3-column structure for notes, homework, and, a new addition, videos. As before, I used different color for each course for better visual distinction.</p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>Although an academic project, we had exposure working with a client on a UX project and had to consider real-world limitations of not only financial resources but time and patient privacy as well. Despite these limitations, through learning and applying the various interaction methods of ethnography studies and participatory workshops, we were able to gain a good depth of knowledge and maximize the few on-site visits with had with RCP. Taking this research to a well-grounded prototype, we scoped this project to manageable goal where we as a team of experience designers can identify a business problem and design a proposal that is realistic for a small business to implement. </p>
